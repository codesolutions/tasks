# Terminal Project Tracker

A terminal-based tool for tracking personal projects, their associated tickets (tasks), and their development lifecycle through pull request monitoring and notifications. It's designed for developers who spend a lot of time in the terminal and want a quick, keyboard-driven way to manage their current work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

1.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3 and the `requests` library installed.
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
    For desktop notifications on Linux, the following tools are required:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install notify-send xdotool # Debian/Ubuntu
    ```

2.  **Configuration File**: The first time you run the script, it will create a `config.json` file in the same directory. You **must** edit this file before the application will run properly.

    ```json
    {
        "API_TOKEN": "PASTE_YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE",
        "USER_ID": 1234,
        "LANGUAGE": "fi"
    }
    ```
    * `API_TOKEN`: Your Bearer token for the Stash/Bitbucket API.
    * `USER_ID`: Your numeric user ID from the API. This is used to distinguish your comments from others'.
    * `LANGUAGE`: Set the display language. Defaults to `"fi"`. Change to `"en"` for English.

3.  **Language Files**: The application looks for translations in a `lang` directory. Ensure `lang/en.json` and `lang/fi.json` exist.
