# Terminal Project Tracker

A terminal-based tool for tracking personal projects, their associated tickets (tasks), and their development lifecycle through pull request monitoring and notifications. It's designed for developers who spend a lot of time in the terminal and want a quick, keyboard-driven way to manage their current work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

1.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3 and the `requests` library installed.
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
    For desktop notifications on Linux, the following tools are required:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install notify-send xdotool # Debian/Ubuntu
    ```

2.  **Configuration File**: The first time you run the script, it will create a `config.json` file in the same directory. You **must** edit this file before the application will run properly.

    ```json
    {
        "API_TOKEN": "PASTE_YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE",
        "USER_ID": 1234,
        "LANGUAGE": "fi",
        "NOTIFICATION_WINDOW_TITLE": "TODAYTASKS",
        "BROWSER_COMMAND": [
            "/usr/bin/google-chrome",
            "--profile-directory=Profile 1",
            "--new-window"
        ]
    }
    ```
    * `API_TOKEN`: Your Bearer token for the Stash/Bitbucket API.
    * `USER_ID`: Your numeric user ID from the API. This is used to distinguish your comments from others'.
    * `LANGUAGE`: Set the display language. Defaults to `"fi"`. Change to `"en"` for English.
    * `NOTIFICATION_WINDOW_TITLE`: The title of the terminal window to focus when a notification is sent.
    * `BROWSER_COMMAND`: A list containing the command and arguments to launch a web browser for meeting links.
    * NOTE: Change STASH_URL_CHANGE_ME from APP itself!!! @todo

3.  **Language Files**: The application looks for translations in a `lang` directory. Ensure `lang/en.json` and `lang/fi.json` exist.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Run the application**:
    To allow the app to focus itself for notifications, it's recommended to launch it with a specific terminal title.
    ```bash
    # Example for gnome-terminal
    gnome-terminal --title='TODAYTASKS' -- /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/jira_tracker.py
    ```

2.  **Create a new project**:
    Type `n Your-Project-Name` and press `Enter`.

3.  **Add a ticket (task)**:
    With a project active, type `a https://your.jira.com/browse/TICKET-123` and press `Enter`.

4.  **Add a Pull Request link**:
    * Use the `Up`/`Down` arrow keys to highlight the ticket you want to add a PR to.
    * Type `pr https://your.git.repo/pull-requests/42` and press `Enter`. The app will now monitor this PR.

5.  **Add a note**:
    * To add a note to the active project, type `note This is a project-level note.` and press `Enter`.
    * To add a note to a specific ticket, first highlight it with the arrow keys, then type your `note` command.

6.  **View, Edit & Delete Notes**:
    * Press `Shift+TAB` to enter the dedicated notes view for the selected item (project or ticket).
    * In the notes view, use `Up`/`Down` to select a note.
    * Press `d` to **delete** the selected note.
    * Type text and press `Enter` to add a new note.
    * Press `Shift+TAB` or `ESC` to return to the main view.

7.  **Mark items as done**:
    * Highlight a ticket and press `Enter` to toggle its done status `[ ]` / `[X]`.
    * To mark the entire active project as complete (and stop the timer), type `x` and press `Enter`.
